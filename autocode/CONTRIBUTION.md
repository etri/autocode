# Contribution Guidelines for autocode

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **autocode**.

This document describes how to report issues, propose new features, and submit code or documentation changes to the project.

## 1. Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to maintain a professional and respectful attitude.

- Be respectful and constructive in all discussions.
- Avoid any discriminatory or offensive language.
- Focus on technical issues and solutions, not on individuals.

## 2. Reporting Issues

Bug reports and feature requests should be submitted through the project's issue tracker.

When creating an issue, please include the following information whenever possible:

1. **Summary**: A short description of the problem or request.
2. **Environment**:
   - Operating system and version
   - Compiler or runtime version
   - Relevant dependency versions
3. **Steps to Reproduce**:
   - A step-by-step description of how to reproduce the problem
   - Minimal code examples or configuration files, if available
4. **Expected vs Actual Behavior**:
   - What you expected to happen
   - What actually happened

If labels are available (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`), please select the appropriate ones.

## 3. Proposing New Features

When proposing a new feature, please open an issue first and describe:

- **Motivation / Background**: Why this feature is needed and what problem it solves.
- **Use Cases**: How the feature will be used in real scenarios.
- **Alternatives**: Any alternative approaches or workarounds you have considered.
- **Scope**: What should be included in a minimal viable implementation.

If possible, attach or link to a short design document to make discussion easier.
